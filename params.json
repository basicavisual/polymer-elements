Additionally, I've added a `my-elements` folder where you can find elements that you may find useful for your projects. Every component is contained in its own folder including:\r\n\r\n* Dependencies (if any)\r\n* Component HTML (something-element.html)\r\n* Demo HTML (demo.html)\r\n\r\nI'll like to add that there's a beautiful documentation for polymer components following these links:\r\n\r\n* [API Reference](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html)\r\n* [10-min to Polymer]()\r\n* [Using the elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/usingelements.html)\r\n* [..and more.](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/material.html)\r\n\r\nAs an intention for simplicity, I'll try to make them as intuitive as possible but there's always a chance to improve, so feel free to contact me. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
