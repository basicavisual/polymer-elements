Welcome to polymer-elements: Polymer core-elements + paper-elements + my-elements
===


This repository is tightly, and _bower-ly_, coupled with @ebidel's [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

You'll find all the `core-elements` and `paper-elements` as updated as the Polymer Project updates. Additionally, I've added a `my-elements` folder where you can find elements that you may find useful for your projects. Every component is contained in its own folder including:

* Dependencies (if any)
* Component HTML (something-element.html)
* Demo HTML (demo.html)

I'll like to add that there's a beautiful documentation for polymer components following these links:

* [API Reference](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html)
* [10-min to Polymer]()
* [Using the elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/usingelements.html)
* [..and more.](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/material.html)

As an intention for simplicity, I'll try to make them as intuitive as possible but there's always a chance to improve, so feel free to contact me.
