Welcome to polymer-elements
===


This repository is tightly (and _bower-ly_) coupled with @ebidel's [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org/).

You'll find all the [`core-elements`](https://www.polymer-project.org/components/core-elements/demo.html) and [`paper-elements`](https://www.polymer-project.org/components/paper-elements/demo.html) as updated as the Polymer Project updates. Additionally, I've added a [`my-elements`](https://github.com/chuycepeda/polymer-elements/tree/master/my_elements) folder where you can find elements that you may find useful for your projects. Every component is contained in its own folder including:

* Dependencies (if any)
* Component HTML (something-element.html)
* Demo HTML (demo.html)

<h2>Usage</h2>

- [ ] Clone repository or download zip.
- [ ] Open a terminal window
- [ ] Go to your downloaded path (extracted or cloned)
- [ ] Start a server (i.e. run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`)
- [ ] Open your internet browser at the server port (i.e. 8000):

	http://localhost:8000/bower-components
	
	http://localhost:8000/my-elements
	
_You'll find each element's folder has its own documentation, of course, polymer-based._



<h2>Additionals</h2>
I'll like to add that there's a beautiful documentation for polymer components following these links:

* [API Reference](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/polymer/polymer.html)
* [10-min to Polymer]()
* [Using the elements](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/usingelements.html)
* [..and more.](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/elements/material.html)

At [`my-elements`](https://github.com/chuycepeda/polymer-elements/tree/master/my_elements) folder you'll also find a [`seed-element`](https://github.com/chuycepeda/polymer-elements/tree/master/my_elements/seed-element), which is an edited version of polymer's seed. You can duplicate this element's folder and use it as a template for your own developments and be part of the future.


Finally, as an intention for simplicity, I'll try to make them as intuitive as possible but there's always a chance to improve, so feel free to contact me for the betterment of this respository or just having some :beers:.
